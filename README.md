## Abstract

Detection and Segmentation of Plam trees is an essential task for monitoring, geolocating, and estimating their canopy size, individual health indices, and yields, especially in large urban areas where we have a complex mixture of different tree species that could be hard to distinguish using traditional machine learning techniques. In this work, we used the fully-convolutional U-Net Deep Learning architecture trained on more than 1000 annotated palm trees in our region to segment the palm trees. We also used Patching and Smooth Unpatcing techniques to use this algorithm on large scenes, where with the help of Connected Component Labeling, we separated and counted each individual tree. This workflow shows excellent potential in segmenting palm trees, with a meager False-Negative ratio. Also, basic Image pro-cessing techniques such as rationing and thresholding for the False Positives lowered the errors substan-tially. This U-Net-based technique can reduce the cost of monitoring palm trees in large cities and could be beneficial to policymakers.
